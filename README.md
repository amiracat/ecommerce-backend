# E-commerce Back-end

This app is the working back end for an e-commerce site. I configured a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Because this application isnâ€™t deployed, you can view a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10yyH8n00cgRlJkkYhSAgD_-dZEWRZK0d/view

This project was fun to work on so please watch the video walkthrough at the link above.
